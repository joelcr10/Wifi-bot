# Wifi-bot
The Wifi-bot is a python program which automatically reconnects to the same wifi when it gets disconnected and connects to the next available wifi when the current wifi has no internet.


The primary intent in creating this program was that our college wifi gets disconnected frequently and we have to connect to the wifi again and again.
Therefore to avoid this hassle, I created this python bot.

Functions of app:
The app runs in the background and always checks whether the computer has internet or not.
when the Wifi gets disconnected, the program automatically connects to that same wifi.
when the wifi has no internet access, the program automatically connects to the next college wifi.
